# Daily-sports-activity-recognition-from-movement-sensor-data-in-R.
Deploy Predictive Model for daily/sports activity recognition from movement sensor data in R.

* Reshaping the 3D features to 2D features, performed one-hot encoding on the target variables.
* Normalizing the range of the features and reducing the high-dimensional features by implementing PCA. 
* Deploying a 2 layered neural network model.Tuning the optimal 2 layered regularized model and finding the optimal values for the hyper parameters.
* In the end we successfully obtain a predictive model having an accuracy of 95%.
